function pointList = generateScanningPoints(app, object, distanceThres, surfaceInterpolation)
% Generates *almost* evenly spaced points along the surface of
% the object. Spacing between points depends on variable
% distanceThres, which is the distance the points should have
% between each other and distanceThresTolerance which allows the
% distance to vary within set interval since in some cases
% evenly spaced points are impossible.

% Points are generated along the surface by stepping around the
% object in a cylindrical coordinate system, starting at
% theta = 0 until theta is 0 again. The algorithm works from
% the top of the object to the bottom, decrementing the Z value
% everytime a round around the object is completed. The
% projection onto the object surface (R value) is found through
% a interpolation algorithm. Distance between points are
% controlled by finding the closest point in the same row and
% the row above, and adjusting the point's position accordingly.
